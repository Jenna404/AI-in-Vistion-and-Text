Explore the significance of AI in text and vision applications.

Use Keras, a very popular deep learning framework, in combination with Google Collaboratory as a cloud solution that uses Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to speed up the task of image classification.

Deep dive into the core elements of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) â€“ convolution, pooling, and their implementation in Keras. 

Design and build convolutional neural network architectures tailored to specific image classification
